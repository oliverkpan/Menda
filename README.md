# Menda

### About
During Hack Western 7, from November 20-22, myself and 3 others created Menda, a mental health self-management application. We were awarded **Best Health Hack** by Sunlife!

### How it works

After a user records a 10 second video talking about their day, Menda uses emotion detection and facial recognition to recommend resources. Users can see a daily log of their well being, in which Menda curates personalized suggestions over time.
